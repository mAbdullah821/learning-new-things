# Protocol Buffers Overview:

Protocol Buffers (protobufs) is a language-agnostic data serialization format developed by Google. It allows you to define the structure of your data in a schema, generate code in various programming languages, and then serialize/deserialize objects based on that schema. This makes it a powerful tool for communication between different services written in different languages.

## Key Concepts:

1. **Message:** A message is similar to a data structure or class in programming languages. It contains fields that represent the data you want to serialize.

2. **Tag (ID):** Each field in a message has a tag or identifier (e.g., `username = 1;`). Tags are used for ordering during serialization and deserialization.

3. **Serialization and Deserialization:** Serialization is the process of converting an object into a binary format that can be sent over the network. Deserialization is the reverse process of reconstructing the object from the binary data.

4. **Nested Message:** You can define a message inside another message, creating a nested structure.

5. **Repetition (repeated):** Fields can be marked as repeated, indicating they can contain multiple values (e.g., `repeated string phones = 5;`).

## Tag Importance in Google Protocol Buffers

In Google Protocol Buffers (protobufs), tags play a crucial role in defining the structure of your data. Let’s dive into what these tags do:

### Tagged Fields:

In a message definition, each field is assigned a unique numbered tag. These tags serve as identifiers for the fields in the binary format of the message.

- **Importance:**
  - Tags uniquely identify fields during serialization and deserialization.
  - Changing tags after a message type is in use can lead to compatibility issues with existing data or code1.

### Serialization and Deserialization:

When you serialize a message (convert it to binary format for storage or transmission), the tags are used to organize the fields. During deserialization (reading the binary data back into a structured format), the tags help identify and map the data back to the corresponding fields.

- **Importance:**
  - Tags facilitate the organization and identification of fields during data conversion processes.

### Compact Data Storage:

Protocol buffers are designed for compact data storage. By using tags, they efficiently encode structured data. Unlike XML, protobufs are smaller, faster, and simpler, making them ideal for various scenarios, including communications protocols and data storage2.

- **Importance:**
  - Tags contribute to the efficiency of encoding and decoding structured data in a compact format.

### Summary:

In summary, tags in protobufs ensure efficient serialization, help maintain compatibility, and allow for extensibility without breaking existing services. They’re a fundamental part of defining your data structure in this language-neutral, platform-neutral format.

## Your Proto File Explained:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

message Person {
    string username = 1;
    int32 id = 2;
    required string email = 3;

    message FullName {
        required string firstName = 1;
        string lastName = 2;
    }

    FullName userFullName = 4;
    repeated string phones = 5;
}

message Worker {
    repeated Person people = 1;
}
```

## Explanation:

### Person Message:

- **Fields:**
  - `username` (string, tag 1)
  - `id` (int32, tag 2)
  - `email` (string, required, tag 3)
  - `userFullName` (nested message, tag 4)
  - `phones` (repeated string, tag 5)

### FullName Nested Message:

- **Fields:**
  - `firstName` (string, required, tag 1)
  - `lastName` (string, tag 2)

### Worker Message:

- **Field:**
  - `people` (repeated Person, tag 1)

### Additional Notes:

- In proto3, all fields are optional by default. If not provided, they take on default values (empty string for string, 0 for numbers, null for objects).

- You can use the `required` keyword to specify that a field must be provided.

- Considerations for making changes to the schema: Use deprecation for fields you want to remove or change, and only remove them after ensuring all systems have adapted.

## Conclusion:

Protocol Buffers provide a structured and efficient way for services to communicate. You define a schema, generate code, and use it to serialize and deserialize objects. The schema acts as a contract between services, ensuring a consistent data format.

# Evolving Protobufs: Making Changes Safely

When working with Google Protocol Buffers (protobufs), maintaining a flexible and evolving schema is crucial for seamless communication between services. Making changes such as removing a field, altering tags, or changing data types requires a structured approach to avoid compatibility issues. Here's a systematic way to handle these changes:

## 1. Understanding the Role of Tags:

Tags in protobufs are essential for the serialization and deserialization of data. They serve as unique identifiers for fields, ensuring proper ordering during data transmission.

## 2. Importance of Compatibility:

To maintain compatibility between services, it's crucial not to change tags or remove fields abruptly. Any alterations can break existing data or code in other services.

## 3. Handling Field Removal:

### 3.1. Deprecation:

- Mark the field you intend to remove as deprecated in the protobufs schema.
- Allow some time for other systems to adapt to the deprecation (months or as needed).

### 3.2. Removal:

- Once you're confident that all systems have adjusted, safely remove the deprecated field from the protobufs schema.

## 4. Changing Tags or Data Types:

### 4.1. Deprecation:

- If you need to change tags or data types, follow a similar deprecation process.
- Mark the existing field as deprecated.

### 4.2. Introduction of Changes:

- Introduce a new field with the desired changes, including new tags or data types.

### 4.3. System Adoption:

- Allow sufficient time for all systems to adopt the new changes.
- Ensure that all systems have transitioned to the updated field.

### 4.4. Safe Removal:

- Once confident in system adaptation, safely remove the deprecated field.

## 5. Handling Optional Fields in Proto3:

In proto3, every field is optional by default. If a field is not provided, it takes on the default value of its type. To distinguish between default and user-entered values, consider wrapping fields in objects.

- Wrap fields in objects (e.g., `FullName` message) to differentiate between null and default values.

## 6. Naming Considerations:

While changing names is possible, it's recommended to keep tags and types consistent across services. Changing names should only be done when absolutely necessary.

## 7. Conclusion:

Evolving protobufs involves a careful process of deprecation, introducing changes, ensuring system adaptation, and finally, safe removal. This approach ensures a smooth transition while maintaining compatibility between services. Remember, patience is key when implementing changes to protobufs schemas.
